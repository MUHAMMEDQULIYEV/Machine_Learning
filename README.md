# Machine Learning Repository

This repository contains machine learning projects and exploratory data analysis using Python, scikit-learn, pandas, and visualization libraries.

## Projects

### 1. Student Performance Analysis
**Location:** `Student_Performance/`

Analysis of student performance data with multiple factors affecting academic outcomes.

**Dataset Features:**
- Student demographics (age, gender)
- Educational factors (school type, parent education level)
- Study habits (study hours, study method, attendance)
- Lifestyle factors (internet access, travel time, extra activities)
- Academic scores (math, science, english, overall scores and final grades)

**Analysis Includes:**
- Exploratory data analysis with Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Distribution analysis of study hours
- Performance correlation analysis
- Demographic grouping and comparisons
- Score relationships and patterns

**Files:**
- `model.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with analysis
- `Student_Performance.csv` - Dataset

### 2. Titanic Survival Prediction
**Location:** `Titanic/`

Classic Kaggle competition dataset for predicting passenger survival on the Titanic.

**Files:**
- `model.ipynb` - Analysis and prediction model
- `train.csv` - Training dataset
- `test.csv` - Test dataset
- `gender_submission.csv` - Sample submission

### 3. Linear Regression Learning
**Location:** `LearnLinearRegression/`

Learning materials and practice for linear regression concepts.
